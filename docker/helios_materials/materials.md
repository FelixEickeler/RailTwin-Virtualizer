# Materials
This is the place to store material files for spectral or intensity matching.
The following ones will be used and should be put here

1. concrete1 (sleepers) 0598UUUCNC
   Approximately 30-year-old runway construction concrete with (mostly granite) aggregate showing. 
   Sample was light gray and weathered. 
   jhu.becknic.manmade.concrete.construction.solid.0598uuu.spectrum.txt

2. concrete2 (also sleepers) 0424UUUCNC
   Variegated construction concrete, with quartz and limestone aggregate showing.
   Sample was gray, and slightly soiled. Concrete was from runway side strips.
   jhu.becknic.manmade.concrete.paving.solid.0424uuu.spectrum.txt 

3. steel (rails) 0526UUUSTLa
   Weathered, galvanized bare steel from roof and vent covers. Sample was completely oxidized. 
   jhu.becknic.manmade.roofing.metal.solid.0526uuu.spectrum.txt

4. aluminium (cables) 0384UUUALM [INCLUDED]
   Bare aluminum metal that is weathered and scratched/scored.  From electronics, roofings, switch covers. 
   Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.becknic.manmade.roofing.metal.solid.0384uuu.spectrum.txt

5. conifer (trees) [INCLUDED]
   Conifer trees.  Spectra were assembled from two segments; the bidirectional VNIR and SWIR comprising segment one, and 
   the hemispherical MWIR and TIR comprising segment two. Both segments used needle piles to simulate a conifer canopy.

5. Tree ACRU-2-19 [Acer]
   Samples were collected as part of NSF Macrosystem Biology proposal titled: Collaborative Research:  Thermal controls 
   on ecosystem metabolism and function: scaling from leaves to canopies to regions. Samples were collected and overnighted 
   to JPL facilities for processing. The same leaves were processed in the Nicolet and then measured using the ASD.
